My name is Patroklos (argp) Argyroudis and I am a computer security
researcher. My main expertise is vulnerability research, exploit
development, reverse engineering and source code auditing. I have
presented my research at several international security conferences
(Black Hat USA, Black Hat EU, Infiltrate, PH-Neutral, ZeroNights,
etc.) on topics such as kernel exploitation, heap exploitation, kernel
protection technologies, and electronic payments.

I hold a PhD on Computer Science from the University of Dublin, Trinity
College, where I have also worked as a postdoctoral researcher on applied
cryptography; designing, implementing and attacking network security
protocols.

My professional profile is available
[on LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/patroklos/). Sometimes
[I tweet interesting things](https://twitter.com/_argp), but most often
I just explore black metal lore.

I am affiliated with [CENSUS S.A](http://census-labs.com/), Greece's
premiere IT/computer security consultancy. Most of the open source code
I have released and the projects I am contributing to can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/argp/). A selection of my research
work is available [here](/research/).
