I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis yesterday. My external examiner was [Professor David Chadwick][1] and our discussion was extremely interesting and thought provoking. I will make a few minor corrections during the next couple of weeks and submit the final draft. Thanks to everyone who sent their congratulations.
