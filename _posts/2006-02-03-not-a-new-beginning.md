I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis yesterday. My external examiner was
[Professor David Chadwick](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dwc8/) and
our discussion was extremely interesting and thought provoking. I will make
a few minor corrections during the next couple of weeks and submit the final
thesis. Thanks to everyone who sent their congratulations.
