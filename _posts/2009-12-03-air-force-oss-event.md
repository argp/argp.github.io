Our talk presented an overview of the available free/open source software that can be used to build complete security solutions for public offices and infrastructure. Furthermore, we analysed recorded cyberwarfare incidents and how the open source model can aid in establishing robust defenses. The slides from our presentation are available [here][3] (in Greek).

We would like to cordially thank Professor Antonios Andreatos for inviting us to the event and for his organisational efforts.
