The [new Phrack issue][1] is out at last!

My contribution to Phrack issue #66 is an [article on exploiting FreeBSD&#8217;s kernel memory allocator][2], or UMA &#8211; the universal memory allocator. The initial inspiration to work on this subject came to me from signedness.org challenge #3 by karl, therefore I felt it was the right thing to do to add karl as a co-author.

Issue #66 contains in total three articles by Greek authors, [Exploiting DLmalloc frees in 2009][3] by huku and [Exploiting TCP Persist Timer Infiniteness][4] by ithilgore in addition to mine. And that&#8217;s just amazing!
