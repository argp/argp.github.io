The [new Phrack issue](http://www.phrack.org/issues/66/1.html) is out
at last!

My contribution to Phrack issue #66 is an [article on exploiting FreeBSD's
kernel memory allocator](http://www.phrack.org/issues/66/8.html#article), or
UMA - the universal memory allocator. The initial inspiration to work on
this subject came to me from signedness.org challenge #3 by karl, therefore
I felt it was the right thing to do to add karl as a co-author.

Issue #66 contains in total three articles by Greek authors, [Exploiting 
DLmalloc frees in 2009](http://www.phrack.org/issues/66/6.html#article)
by huku and [Exploiting TCP Persist Timer 
Infiniteness](http://www.phrack.org/issues/66/9.html#article) by ithilgore
in addition to mine. And that's just amazing!
