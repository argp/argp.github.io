Yesterday I visited [University College Cork][1] in order to participate in the [IRCSET][2] Computer Science Research Achievement Award as I was chosen to be one of the eleven finalists. As my train to Cork was a bit late, the minute I arrived to the event hall I was requested to make my presentation since I was the first one on the alphabetically sorted list of the eleven participants. The whole procedure was pretty stressful since each one of us had to present his work up to this point to a panel of mostly non-technical judges in just ten minutes.

Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t selected to be one of the five people that went to the final round of the competition. I believe that this is due to the fact that most of the other participants were far ahead of me in their PhD work and had interesting results to present. No regrets or bad feelings though. The work of the five people that were selected was really impressive and I hope that next year I am going to be at a similar point in my research. At the end of the event I was awarded a certificate of being a finalist and a money check. Final note: It felt a bit weird being the only non-Irish finalist. I hope that next year more non-Irish IRCSET scholars are going to be selected as finalists and compete in the event.
