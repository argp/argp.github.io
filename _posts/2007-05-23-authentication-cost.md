Lately I have focused much of my research efforts on the investigation of 
incorporating economic considerations into the design of network security 
technologies, and particularly of authentication mechanisms. As a preliminary 
result of this work I, along with Robert McAdoo and [Professor Donal 
O'Mahony](https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Donal.OMahony/), have written a paper on
comparing the costs of three different public key authentication infrastructures.
Our work has been published at the [Workshop on the Economics of Securing the
Information Infrastructure](http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000815.html).
The abstract follows (the paper in its entirety is available
[here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&type=pdf&doi=10.1.1.215.1496)):

> The holy grail of Internet security still remains a global authentication 
> infrastructure that will be able to provide the basis for secure communications 
> across a wide range of network technologies. The failure of Public Key 
> Infrastructure (PKI) to fulfill this role clearly demonstrates the complexity 
> of the problem and its interdisciplinary nature which transcends technical 
> difficulties and has socioeconomic aspects. In this paper, we focus on the 
> economic dimensions of the problem and perform a comparison of three existing 
> public key authentication infrastructures. Specifically, we present a security 
> assessment of the PKI, Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Secure Shell (SSH) 
> authentication systems while modelling the economic value exchanges between the 
> participating actors. Our approach constitutes a step towards the examination 
> of the authentication problem in a wider context than just a technical one. 
> Finally, we show how this study can help in the design of a solution for secure 
> telecommunications.

The feedback from the reviewers was very encouraging and the presentation at 
the workshop, which was given by Robert since I didn't manage to renew my 
visa in time, successful. I plan to pursue this research topic further and 
ultimately develop a framework that can be used to understand the trade-offs 
between the violation risks and the (not just monetary) costs related to 
various security technologies.

If you have any thoughts and/or suggestions on the topic I would be happy to 
hear them.
