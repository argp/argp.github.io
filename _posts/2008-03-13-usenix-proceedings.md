All [USENIX][1]-sponsored conference proceedings were in the past freely available, except those of conferences held in the last twelve months. Those were only available to USENIX members. Today, USENIX [announced][2] that they are making *all* their conference proceedings [freely available][3] to everyone.

This is going to be very helpful for all researchers, although I don&#8217;t think that there are many people interested in any area of systems research that are not USENIX members already. In any case, I hope that ACM, IEEE and Springer/LNCS proceedings become freely available as well (but somehow I doubt it).
