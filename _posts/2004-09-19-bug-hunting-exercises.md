Gimpel Software (I have absolutely no affiliation with them) have a nice [bug of the month][1] section in their website. Although it mainly serves as a promotion mechanism for their commercial lint utilities, it offers a nice opportunity to test and keep sharp your C (and to a lesser extend C++) bug hunting abilities.
