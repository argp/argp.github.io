[ÆTHER][1] (the name of the architecture that I have designed and mostly implemented for my Ph.D.) has been selected as a finalist project in the research and development category of the 2004 RSA European Information Security Awards. I didn&#8217;t win, but I got a complimentary registration at RSA Conference Europe 2004. Visiting Barcelona was a great experience and I met some really interesting people at the conference. I even saw, but unfortunately didn&#8217;t have a chance to meet, Bruce Schneier.
