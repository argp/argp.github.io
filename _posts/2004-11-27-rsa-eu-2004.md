(the name of the architecture that I have designed and implemented for my Ph.D.)
has been selected as a finalist project in the research and development category
of the 2004 RSA European Information Security Awards. I didn't win, but I got a
complimentary registration at RSA Conference Europe 2004. Visiting Barcelona was
a great experience and I met some really interesting people at the conference. I
even saw, but unfortunately didn't have a chance to meet, Bruce Schneier.
