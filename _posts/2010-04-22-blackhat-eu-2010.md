[Black Hat Europe 2010](http://blackhat.com/html/bh-eu-10/bh-eu-10-home.html)
is now over and after a brief [ash
cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull)
caused delay I am back in Greece. It has been a great conference, flawlessly
organized and with many outstanding presentations. I would like to thank everyone
that attended my
[presentation](http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-eu-10/bh-eu-10-archives.html#Argyroudis)
but also all the kind people that spoke to me before and afterwards. I hope to
meet all of you again at a future event.

My presentation, titled "Binding the Daemon: FreeBSD Kernel Stack and 
Heap Exploitation", was divided into four parts. In the first part I gave 
an overview of the published work on the subject of kernel exploitation for 
Unix-like operating systems. The second and third parts were the main body of 
the presentation. Specifically, in the second part I explained how a kernel 
stack overflow vulnerability on FreeBSD can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary 
code execution. The third part focused on a detailed security analysis of the 
Universal Memory Allocator (UMA), the FreeBSD kernel's memory allocator. 
I explored how UMA overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution in the 
context of the latest stable FreeBSD kernel (8.0-RELEASE), and I developed an 
exploitation methodology for privilege escalation and kernel continuation.

In the fourth and final part I gave a demo of a FreeBSD kernel local 0day 
vulnerability that I have discovered. However, I have not released the details 
of the vulnerability in my Black Hat presentation. The details of this 
vulnerability (plus the proof-of-concept exploit) will be released shortly, 
once the relevant code is patched and the official advisory is out.
