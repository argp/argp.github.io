Last Thursday, March 2nd, [Vint Cerf](http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/cerf.html)
gave a talk in Dublin. Although it was mainly part of a marketing and recruiting
event of Google, it was not something to be missed. How often do you get the
chance to see and talk to a "founding father of the TCP/IP stack"?

Fortunately, the talk was fairly technical and Dr Cerf mentioned numerous details
on various decisions they (he and Bob Kahn) had to take during the design of the
TCP/IP stack and packet switching networking in general. He explained that his
main regret is the decision to not include IP addresses at the TCP layer, something
that would have eased multihoming and ultimately mobility at the expense of a
slightly higher byte overhead. Towards the end of the talk he shared with everyone
his obvious passion for space exploration and some highlights of his work on
interplanetary network protocols.
