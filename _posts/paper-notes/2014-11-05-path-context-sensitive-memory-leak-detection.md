Title: Path and context sensitive inter-procedural memory leak detection  
PDF: <a href="http://cpl0.net/~argp/papers/44a45c88f524da1a62fbf91581d8ede9.pdf" target="_blank">http://cpl0.net/~argp/papers/44a45c88f524da1a62fbf91581d8ede9.pdf</a>

Models heap objects, tracks their state (not pointers to), inter-procedural analysis via  
function summaries; solver for path feasibility. Straightforward.
