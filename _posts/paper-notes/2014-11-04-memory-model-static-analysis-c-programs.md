Title: A memory model for static analysis of C programs<br>
PDF: <a href="/public/44f93d2a09e3d91eca160b387db6cd8c.pdf">44f93d2a09e3d91eca160b387db6cd8c.pdf</a>

Nice read; defines a region-based memory model that can describe C semantics
and keep track of lvalue expressions; like a poor man's alias analysis.
Implementation available as part of the clang analyzer.
