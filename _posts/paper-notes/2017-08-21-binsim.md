Title: BinSim: Trace-based semantic binary diffing via system call sliced segment equivalence checking<br>
PDF: <a href="/public/0070bdf0db1fe29e6730d8e63662b0b3.pdf">0070bdf0db1fe29e6730d8e63662b0b3.pdf</a>

BinSim is a dynamic system for identifying differences between two malware
samples based on the executed system and API calls. I decided to read the paper
in order to see if I can reuse anything in my usual bindiffing workflow for patch
analysis and symbol porting. Since it is dynamic, its first analysis step is to
run the two target x86 executables with the same input. BinSim uses BitBlaze as
its dynamic analysis infrastructure, and therefore its next step is to lift the
execution trace logs to BitBlaze's Vine IL. The system and API calls from the two
traces are collected and aligned based on their call sequence. Then, the arguments
of the matched calls are checked for equivalence. This is done by collecting all
instructions that affect them using backward slicing, and calculating each
slice's weakest precondition symbolic formula. Finally, the two formulas,
each representing an aligned system or API call from the target executables, are
checked for equivalence with a constraint solver. Similarity scores (1.0 for
a match, 0.7 for an approximate match, and 0.5 for an unknown case) are used
to summarize the equivalence for the whole binaries.
