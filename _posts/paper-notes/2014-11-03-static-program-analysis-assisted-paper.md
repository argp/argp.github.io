Note: A <a href="https://twitter.com/_argp/statuses/478777665898700800">while back</a>
I started tweeting notes on research papers I'm reading. Gradually the notes became
more verbose, making Twitter a poor medium for them. So, I decided to start keeping
the notes here and tweet the links to the posts instead. I will start the
"paper notes" category with all the previous notes I have twitted so far.

Read that yesterday evening; very brief and underdeveloped for my taste.
