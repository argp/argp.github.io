Note: A <a href="https://twitter.com/_argp/statuses/478777665898700800" target="_blank">while back</a> I started tweeting notes on research papers I&#8217;m reading. Gradually the notes became more verbose, making Twitter a poor medium for them. So, I decided to start keeping the notes on this blog and tweet the links to the posts instead. I will start the &#8220;paper notes&#8221; category with all the previous notes I have twitted so far.

Read that yesterday evening; very brief and underdeveloped for my taste.
