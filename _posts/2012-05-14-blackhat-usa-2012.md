Continuing our work on jemalloc exploitation, myself and Chariton Karamitas 
(intern at CENSUS S.A.) are presenting
[Owning Firefox's Heap](https://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-12/bh-us-12-briefings.html#Argyroudis)
at [Black Hat USA 2012](https://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-12/bh-us-12-briefings.html).
This presentation extends our recently published
[Phrack paper](http://www.phrack.org/issues/68/10.html#article) by focusing
specifically on the most widely used jemalloc application, namely the
[Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) web browser.

The abstract of our talk will give you a good preview of the content: 

> jemalloc is a userland memory allocator that is being increasingly adopted by 
> software projects as a high performance heap manager. It is used in Mozilla 
> Firefox for the Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms, and as the default 
> system allocator on the FreeBSD and NetBSD operating systems. Facebook also 
> uses jemalloc in various components to handle the load of its web services. 
> However, despite such widespread use, there is no work on the exploitation of 
> jemalloc.
> 
> Our research addresses this. We will begin by examining the architecture of 
> the jemalloc heap manager and its internal concepts, while focusing on 
> identifying possible attack vectors. jemalloc does not utilize concepts such as 
> 'unlinking' or 'frontlinking' that have been used 
> extensively in the past to undermine the security of other allocators. 
> Therefore, we will develop novel exploitation approaches and primitives that 
> can be used to attack jemalloc heap corruption vulnerabilities. As a case 
> study, we will investigate Mozilla Firefox and demonstrate the impact of our 
> developed exploitation primitives on the browser's heap. In order to aid 
> the researchers willing to continue our work, we will also release our jemalloc 
> debugging tool belt.
