My name is Patroklos (argp) Argyroudis and I am a computer security
researcher. My main expertise is vulnerability research, exploit
development, reverse engineering and source code auditing. I have
presented my research at several international security conferences
(Black Hat USA, Black Hat EU, Infiltrate, PH-Neutral, ZeroNights,
etc.) on topics such as kernel exploitation, heap exploitation, kernel
protection technologies, and electronic payments.

I hold a PhD on Computer Science from the University of Dublin, Trinity
College, where I have also worked as a postdoctoral researcher on applied
cryptography; designing, implementing and attacking network security protocols.

My professional profile is available

<a href="https://twitter.com/_argp">I tweet about my research</a>, but
most often I just explore black metal lore on Twitter.
