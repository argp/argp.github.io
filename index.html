My name is Patroklos (argp) Argyroudis and I am a computer security
researcher. My main expertise is vulnerability research, exploit
development, reverse engineering and source code auditing. I have
presented my research at several international security conferences
(Black Hat USA, Black Hat EU, Infiltrate, CanSecWest, Chaos Communication
Congress, PH-Neutral, ZeroNights, etc.) on topics such as kernel exploitation,
heap exploitation, kernel protection technologies, and electronic payments.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Dublin, Trinity
College, where I have also worked as a postdoctoral researcher on applied
cryptography; designing, implementing and attacking network security protocols.

My professional profile is available
<a href="http://linkedin.com/in/patroklos/">on LinkedIn</a>. Sometimes
<a href="https://twitter.com/_argp">I tweet about my research</a>, but you
shouldn't take anything on Twitter too seriously; I don't either. Also, I don't
have accounts on Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media sites.

<p>
I am affiliated with
<a href="http://census-labs.com/">CENSUS</a>, a highly specialized IT/computer
security consultancy. Most of the open source code I have released and the projects
I am contributing to can be found <a href="https://github.com/argp/">on GitHub</a>.
A selection of my research work is available <a href="/research/">here</a>. I used
to <a href="/bugs/">kill bugs publicly</a>; nowadays I do it privately.
